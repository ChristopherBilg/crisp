# Introduction

crisp is written in the Rust systems programming language in order to gain the benefits that Rust provides such as; memory management, memory and type safety, systems-level performance, native cross-compiling support, and an easy-to-use dependency (package) registry.

This website is created using the mdBooks Rust crate, and allows documentation to be transpiled from Markdown to static HTML.

There is another portion of the documentation website, located at [chrisbilger.com/crisp/doc/doc/crisp](https://chrisbilger.com/crisp/doc/doc/crisp/), that is built from Rust's native `cargo doc` feature. That portion of the documentation is for other developers to quickly read about the Rust codebase for crisp.
